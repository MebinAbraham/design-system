Users can save their progress and sign out of the service to return to later, by selecting ”Save and sign out” in the header or footer.

    patternlibExample({ "path": "patterns/save-sign-out/examples/save-sign-out-button/index.njk" })
}}

## When to use this pattern

Follow this pattern when a user has started a survey after entering an [access code](/patterns/uac).

## When not to use this pattern

Do not use this pattern if the user has not been required to enter a unique code to access the service.

## How to use this pattern

Use the `signoutButton` object within [page template](/styles/page-template) configuration.  This will ensure the [ghost button](/components/button/#ghost) is placed in the header or footer when there is not enough space available on a small device.

Selecting the button should exit the service, clear any session data from the browser, and save any information the user has submitted before they last selected the “Save and continue” button. The user should then be directed to the signed out page.

### Signed out page

Confirms the user’s progress has been saved and warns them to keep their access code safe.  A call to action to access the service again must be displayed so the user can continue their journey.
